# DotaMarketplace
Final project for ISYS6203 Mobile Application Development practicum, based on the given case.

**Dota Marketplace** is a concept for an application that provides services to users to purchase items in the Dota 2 game. The application runs on Android, and allows users to view a list of purchaseable items, view the seller's location, top-up their balance, make purchases, and view their own transaction history. There are several pages on DotaMarketplace, namely: Login Form, Register Form, Main Form, Buy Item Form, Top Up Form, Seller Location Form, and Transaction History Form.

This application requires an internet connection for the initial download of item data. Item, User, and Transaction data is persistently stored in an SQLite database. This application also makes use of the Google Maps API to perform reverse geocoding of latitude/longitude coordinates and displaying the location with a marker on a map.
